# FieldRotation
This work not only provides an additional mathematical approach of field rotation but also describes an attempt to calculate the rate of field rotation as well as the maximum allowed exposure time. The purpose of our study is helping a wide range of amateur astronomers especially those who have an alt-azimuth mount to estimate this maximum possible exposure. I find that there is a “preferred” time of imaging, especially when the rate of field rotation has not reached the peak yet and the astronomical object is far enough from the horizon. 

In addition, you could download a complete Excel sheet that assists amateur astronomers in calculating the maximum exposure time as function of the observer's latitude, the sidereal rotation of the earth, the hour angle and declination of the astronomical object, the aperture and field of view of the imaging system.
